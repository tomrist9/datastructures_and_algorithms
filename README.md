# Data Structures and Algorithms Journey ðŸš€

This repository is part of my personal journey to master **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** through hands-on problem solving.

Iâ€™m actively learning through a Udemy course focused on DSA fundamentals and advanced techniques, and I reinforce each concept by solving coding problems on platforms like LeetCode. I push my solutions to this repository to track my progress and build a strong foundation for technical interviews and real-world problem solving.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Trees and Graphs
- Hashing
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

## ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™m Practicing

- Writing clean, efficient Java code
- Understanding time and space complexity (Big-O)
- Solving problems using multiple approaches
- Practicing recursion, iteration, and optimizations
- Building confidence in algorithmic thinking

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub
- LeetCode (for problem-solving)

## ðŸ§  Learning Platform
