# ðŸ“š Data Structures and Algorithms Journey 

Welcome to my personal repository for mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Java.  
This repo contains my daily solutions to coding problems from platforms like **LeetCode**and structured implementations of common algorithms and patterns.

Each solution is written with **clean code principles**, proper naming, and explanatory comments.  
My goal is to build a solid foundation for technical interviews, system thinking, and real-world software engineering.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Problem

#### [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

```java
// Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
    int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE, maxProfit = 0;
    for (int price : prices) {
        if (price < minPrice) minPrice = price;
        else maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
    }
    return maxProfit;
}
```
